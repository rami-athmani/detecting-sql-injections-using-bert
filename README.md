# Detecting SQL injections using BERT
## Problem
SQL injection attacks represent a major risk for applications interacting with databases.
An SQL injection consists of injecting malicious SQL code into an SQL query.
The SQL injection is done using an HTTP request carrying the malicious SQL code.
## Objective
Detecting SQL Injections  using BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
## Demo Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data:
   The first step is to load and preprocess the data. This may involve splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, and converting the text data into a format that BERT can understand. This typically involves tokenizing the text data and converting the tokens into numerical embeddings that can be inputted into the model.
   we gonna use the sql injection dataset "sqliv2.csv" from kaggel.
2. Load BERT:
   load the pre-trained BERT model from Ktrain library.
3. Fine-tune BERT:
  fine-tune Bert on our specific task "detecting sql injections",fine-tuning involves training BERT on our training data, with the aim of optimizing its parameters for our classification task
4. Evaluate on validation set:
Once we have fine-tuned BERT, we can evaluate its performance on a validation set. This involves inputting the validation data into the model and comparing its predictions with the true labels. We may need to adjust hyperparameters or experiment with different architectures to improve performance.
5. Test on test set:
After we have finalized our BERT model, we can evaluate its performance on a test set. This involves inputting the test data into the model and comparing its predictions with the true labels. We can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance.
6. Deploy and use:
Once we have a BERT model that performs well on our task, we can deploy it and use it to classify new text data. This may involve serving the model as an API or incorporating it into an existing application.
